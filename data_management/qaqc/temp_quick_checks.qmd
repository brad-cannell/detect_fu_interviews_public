```{r}
# ðŸ”´ I'm just using this code to help me figure out the name of the columns that the original code was manipulating. Again, all these tidyselectors make it difficult to figure out which columns we are mutating.
# This code chunk should be deleted after we get rid of the tidyselectors in the mutate code.
self_rep |> 
  select(
    starts_with("finance") & ends_with("times")
  ) |> 
  names() |> 
  cat(sep = ', ')
```

```{r}
# ðŸ”´ I'm just using this code for quick data checks. Don't keep in the qmd file
self_rep |> 
  select(starts_with("neglect_house_help")) |> 
  filter(!is.na(neglect_house_help))
```

### Data check

Number of columns after cleaning the neglect section.

```{r}
# Data check
ncols <- 257
if (ncol(self_rep) != ncols) {
  stop(
    ncols, " columns expected in self_ref after cleaning the neglect variables. ", 
    ncol(self_rep), " columns found. Check into it."
  )
}
```
