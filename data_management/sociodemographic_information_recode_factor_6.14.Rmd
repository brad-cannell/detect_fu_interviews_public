Load the data tables into the global environment as data frames.We will create factor variables for all categorical variables in the data frames and save them to a new CSV file. 

```{r load data, messages = FALSE}
sociodemographic_information <- read_csv("/Users/anyone/OneDrive - The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston/DETECT/Sociodemographic Information.csv")
```

## Data cleaning.

Here we will convert all variable names to snake case so that everything is uniform.

```{r}
# Convert all variable names to snake case
walk(
  # Grab the names of all data frames in the global environment
  .x = ls()[map_lgl(ls(), ~ is.data.frame(get(.)))],
  .f = function(x) {
    # Grab individual df from environment
    df <- get(x)
    # Grab the variables names
    var_names <- names(df)
    # Convert variable names to snake case
    var_names <- str_replace_all(var_names, '(\\B)([A-Z])', '_\\2')
    # Convert variable names to lower case
    var_names <- str_to_lower(var_names)
    # Fix medstar_id
    var_names[var_names == "medstar_i_d"] <- "medstar_id"
    # assign back to the dataframe
    names(df) <- var_names
    # Replace df with new names in global environment
    assign(x, df, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
)

```


Replace "<92>" and "\x92" with an apostrophe so that values read "Don't know".

```{r}
sociodemographic_information <- data.frame(lapply(
  sociodemographic_information, function(x) {
                  gsub("<92>", "'", x)
              }))

sociodemographic_information <- data.frame(lapply(
  sociodemographic_information, function(x) {
                  gsub("\x92", "'", x)
              }))
```

## Coerce categorical variables to factor variables

### Sociodemographic Information

Create factor variables and match levels to codebook for all categorical variables except race and sode_race. The codebook does not include "Hispanic or Latino" for the race variable, but it is included in this data. For sode_race, several participants have multiple values. During analysis, the researchers may want to collapse some categories of race/ethnicity, so it can be coded correctly at that time.
