title: "Import Data from FileMaker Pro: Observational Measures"
---

# Overview

In this file, we import and do some initial cleaning of the Observational Measures data collected and stored in FileMaker Pro.

```{r, message= FALSE}
# Load all necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
```


# Load data

Load the data table into the global environment as a data frame using the raw csv file. We will create categorical variables with numerical values that match the codebook and also create a factor variable for each categorical variable in the data frame to be used for analysis.

```{r}
obs_meas <- read_csv("../data/filemaker_pro_exports/observational_measures_import.csv")
```
```{r}
# Data check
dim(obs_meas) # 935 107
```

# Clean data

Here we will convert all variable names to snake case so that everything is uniform.

```{r}
# Convert all variable names to snake case
obs_meas <- clean_names(obs_meas)

```

## Create factor variables to match levels in follow-up interview protocol
