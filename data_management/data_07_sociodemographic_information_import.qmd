# Load the data

Load the data table into the global environment as a data frame using the raw csv file. We will create categorical variables with numerical values that match the codebook and also create a factor variable for each categorical variable in the data frame to be used for analysis.

```{r}
sociodemographic_information <- read_csv("../data/filemaker_pro_exports/sociodemographic_information_import.csv")
``` 

# Clean the data

Here we will convert all variable names to snake case so that everything is uniform.

```{r}
# Convert all variable names to snake case

sociodemographic_information <- clean_names(sociodemographic_information)
```

```{r}
# Data check
dim(sociodemographic_information) # 963  28
```

## Remove rows

For MedStar IDs ...92912, ...83082, ...281fa, ...9b0f2, ...3a6e2, and ...4419d, no consent was given. There was no follow-up interview scheduled. There aren't any values in FM Pro. We will delete these records. For more details, see `check_consenting_participants.qmd`.

```{r}
sociodemographic_information <- sociodemographic_information |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "92912")) |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "83082")) |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "281fa")) |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "9b0f2")) |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "3a6e2")) |>
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(medstar_id, "4419d"))
```

```{r}
# Data check
dim(sociodemographic_information) # 957  28
