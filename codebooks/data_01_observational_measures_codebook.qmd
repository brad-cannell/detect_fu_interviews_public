# Load necessary packages and functions

```


# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project pertaining to observational measures.


# Load cleaned data

```{r}
obs <- read_rds(here::here("data", "cleaned_rds_files", "observational_measures_import.rds"))
```


# Data variables check

```{r}
# Compare variables in this data frame to the variables in the most recent 
# version of the cleaned data 

obs_desc_path <- "observational_measures_var_desc.rds"
vars_to_update(observational_measures, obs_desc_path)
```


# Load custom functions

```{r}
source(here::here("r", "variable_descriptions.R"))
source(here::here("r", "identify_codebook_variables_to_update.R"))
```


# Set column attributes

```{r}
# Set the source to "DETECT Follow-up Interview Questions Observational Measures" for all the variables
obs_vars <- obs %>%
  names()

for (i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "DETECT Follow-up Interview Questions Observational Measures"
}
```


# Choose variables that will not have summary statistics

```{r}
no_stats_vars <- c(
  "x_primary_key", "x_created_by", "x_created_timestamp", "x_modified_by", 
  "x_modified_timestamp", "x_error_message", "x_record_status",
