# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project.

```{r}
# Load data from Self Report data set
followup_df <- read_rds("merged_follow_up.rds") #603 973
```

# Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Remove vertical tab data frame
# for example, remove all spaces
followup_df <- followup_df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_remove_all, pattern = fixed("\v")))
```

```{r}
#Move age column to position 12 so that it will not be included as a Admin Variable, and summary statistics will be run
followup_df <- followup_df %>%
  relocate(age, .after =zip_code)
  
```

# Set column attributes

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case administrative data
