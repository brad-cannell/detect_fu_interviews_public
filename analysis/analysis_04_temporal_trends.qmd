# ‚≠êÔ∏è Overview

## This File

This file performs the initial explorations and analyses of Temporal Trends within the MedStar 5-year follow-up data, internally referred to as "Section 4: Temporal Trends".

## MedStar Data Background

The MedStar records were originally recorded in Filemaker Pro. Processing of this data was extensive and across multiple data files. These files are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_fu_interviews_public/wiki).

The primary files of interest for subject-level interest included participant demographic data in the `participant_import.rds` file [created in a separate Quarto file](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_fu_interviews_public/blob/main/data_management/data_01_participant_import.qmd), and the original within-set unique subject ID assignment in `participant_unique_ids.rds` file [created in a separate Quarto file](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_fu_interviews_public/blob/main/data_management/unique_person_identification/data_02_unique_person_detect_fu_data.qmd).

These files originally contained 92,160 observations of approximately 30 demographic variables. Refinement of unique subject ID assignments in subject-linkage to APS resulted in 41,955 values of `ms_id`.

## Internal Files

This document was created as part of the DETECT project, specifically the merger of APS and MedStar data for analysis using the full follow-up period data. Internal documents relating to these files, which contain PHI, are securely stored on the research group's SharePoint in the [task notes folder](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/SPHDETECT-RPC/Shared%20Documents/DETECT%20R01%202018/02%20Shared%20Folders/DETECT%20Follow-up%20Interview%20Data%20Shared/data/notes_documents?csf=1&web=1&e=gLWUzJ).

Notes for the MedStar data are located in the [notes_00_data_medstar.docx](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/SPHDETECT-RPC/Shared%20Documents/DETECT%20R01%202018/02%20Shared%20Folders/DETECT%20Follow-up%20Interview%20Data%20Shared/data/notes_documents/notes_00_data_medstar.docx?d=w7367b418df5644fbb3ff5117908f27d9&csf=1&web=1&e=gueXsZ) file.
